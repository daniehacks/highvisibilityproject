## The High Visibility Project

The High Visibility Project is collecting the stories of women in technology. Whether you are a seasoned professional or a student just starting out, you can directly contribute your experiences, observations and ideas to the larger conversation about tech diversity. Our site features submitted videos from everyone with stories to tell. We want to give women working in technology a platform to speak up and be visible, and give women thinking about working in technology valuable, varied insights and role models.

You can listen to all stories and find more information about the project at [highvisibilityproject.org](http://highvisibilityproject.org).

### Submission Guidelines

1. Please host your video at a video site such as [YouTube](http://youtube.com) or [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com). We don’t have the capacity to host video ourselves, so our posts embed externally-hosted videos only. Once you have uploaded your video, you can submit the publicly-available URL plus your story details (any context you want to write, your Twitter username, website URL, etc.) in a pull request.

2. The best way to submit is via pull request at our GitHub repository. If you aren't comfortable with this process, we're happy to help. Take a look at [GitHub's pull request walkthrough ](http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and let us know if you have questions or need a hand.

3. When recording your video, make sure the sound is clear and background noise is at a minimum. Also, it’s best if the light source is not behind you, since that will make it difficult to see you clearly.

4. While we don’t have a strict policy on language, keep in mind that our videos are intended for a wide audience, especially young women looking for role models. If your story involves sensitive language or situations, please just explain to that effect with your submission and we’ll mark it accordingly with a trigger warning. We review pull requests before including them in the website, so we will not post any material that is offensive or off-message.

5. We like to make our content as accesible as possible, so if you are able to submit a text transcript with your video, that would be wonderful. If not, don't worry. We'll help get it transcribed.

6. If you want to share your story but are worried about anonymity, you may submit text-only under a pseudonym.

### Submission Topics

Are you interested in sharing your story but aren't sure where to start? Here are some good questions to consider.

- What inspired you to work with or learn about technology?
- What role models encouraged, or still encourage, you?
- What challenges you’ve faced in your education or career?
- Your experiences teaching or mentoring other women?
- How you balance work and family?
- Your goals for the future?
- What you’d like girls and young women considering technology to know?

### Contribute

There are a lot of ways you can help the project. If you want to review and merge pull requests, contact the project coordinator, [@jenmyers](http://github.com/jenmyers), to be added as a collaborator. We also need help with transcription, so pull requests transcribing existing videos are welcome.
