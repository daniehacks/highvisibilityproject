<p>The High Visibility Project is collecting the stories of women in technology. Whether you are a seasoned professional or a student just starting out, you can contribute your experiences, observations and ideas to the larger conversation about tech diversity. Our site features submitted videos from everyone with stories to tell. We want to give women working in technology a platform to speak up and be visible, and give women thinking about working in technology valuable, varied insights and role models.</p>

<p>For more information about how to submit, take a look at our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/submit/">submission guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>The project was started in fall of 2011 by web designer/developer <a href="http://jenmyers.net">Jen Myers</a>. After a recent reboot, it is now powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and is managed by volunteers. If you would like to help us, please contact us and ask to become a contributor.</p>
