<p>We want to hear as many voices as we can. Want to submit your story to the collection? Here are the basic guidelines.</p>

<h4>How to Submit</h4>

<p>Please host your video at a video site such as <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> or <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>. We don’t have the capacity to host video ourselves, so our posts embed externally-hosted videos only. Once you have uploaded your video, you can submit the publicly-available URL plus your story details in a pull request.</p>

<p>The best way to submit is via pull request at our <a href="https://github.com/jenmyers/highvisibilityproject">GitHub repository</a>. If you aren't comfortable with this process, we're happy to help. Take a look at <a href="http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">GitHub's pull request walkthrough</a> and let us know if you have questions or need a hand.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can also submit your story and details via our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ad6tw9FjPxOdqAisSZ9zBYtjgxnz43wjDXxrZx8A_q0/viewform">submission form</a>.</p>

<p>When recording your video, make sure the sound is clear and background noise is at a minimum. Also, it’s best if the light source is not behind you, since that will make it difficult to see you clearly.</p>

<p>While we don’t have a strict policy on language, keep in mind that our videos are intended for a wide audience, especially young women looking for role models. If your story involves sensitive language or situations, please just explain to that effect with your submission and we’ll mark it accordingly with a trigger warning. We review pull requests before including them in the website, so we will not post any material that is offensive or off-message.</p>

<p>We like to make our content as accesible as possible, so if you are able to submit a text transcript with your video, that would be wonderful. If not, don't worry. We'll help get it transcribed.</p>

<p>If you want to share your story but are worried about anonymity, you may submit text-only under a pseudonym.</p>

<h4>What to Submit</h4>
